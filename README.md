This study project proposes to be a movie recommendation website, based on the input of a movie, using the TMDB API and presenting five suggestions, also providing which streaming services to watch, for now only in Italy. The final version of the project must have:

-Suggestions of films by genre or name of a previous film (for now only by name)
-Provide direct links to movies in streams (using the Movie of the Night API)
-Randomize suggestions, always generating 5 different suggestions
-Through the TMDB API provide the possibility for the user to favorite movies, list favorite movies and exclude them from their list

At the moment I'm improving the project's architecture, separating the functions into their files. And it already has the function to search for recommendations and list posters, names, movie rates, and the logo of the streaming service available in Italy. The CSS has not been implemented yet.
